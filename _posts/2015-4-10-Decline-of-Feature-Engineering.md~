title: Decline of Feature Engineering 
---

> "*Coming up with features is difficult, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge. When working applications of learning, we spend a lot of time tuning the features. However, these features can be learned.*" 

> "*Large numbers of features is critical. The specific learning algorithm is important, but the ones who can scale to many features also have a big advantage.*"

> "*Often, it's not who has the best algorithm that wins; it's who has the most data.*" 

> "*However, most algorithms 'win' over others by scaling the model and learning more features.*"

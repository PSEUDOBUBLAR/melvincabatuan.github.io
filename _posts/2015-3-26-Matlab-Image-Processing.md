> "*Numerical analysis has always been the black sheep of mathematics. I like to say that mathematics is the art of avoiding computation. In pure mathematics if you have to do a computation then it's because your model is not sophisticated enough, or not elegant enough, or you haven't got the right abstraction. It was just different, it was a new subject and most of the mathematicians at Stanford, I'd say, were happy to see it get out of the department and go its own way elsewhere.*"

> **The Zen of Python**

> "*Beautiful is better than ugly. </br>
    Explicit is better than implicit. </br>
    Simple is better than complex. </br>
    Complex is better than complicated. </br>
    Flat is better than nested. </br>
    Sparse is better than dense. </br>
    Readability counts. </br>
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. </br>
    Although practicality beats purity. </br>
    Errors should never pass silently. </br>
    Unless explicitly silenced. </br>
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. </br>
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it. </br>
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch. </br>
    Now is better than never. </br>
    Although never is often better than RIGHT now. </br>
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea. </br>
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea. </br>
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!*"
